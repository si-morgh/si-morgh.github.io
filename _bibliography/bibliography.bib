  abstract = "Supposer k is a singular strong limit cardinal of countable cofinality, and let <kₙ:n<ω> be an increasing sequence of regular cardinals cofinal in k. In this short note, we show that if cof(2[k]＝k⁺, then forcing with the full product П[n<ω Add (kₙ, 1) collapses 2[k⁺] onto k⁺.This result gives a consistent positive answer to a question asked by Sy Friedman. We also provide a new proof of a result due to Shelah by showing that if, moreover, the sequence carries a scale of length k⁺， then forcing with П[n<w] Add(kₙ, 1) adds a generic filter for Add(， 1), and thus П[n<w] Add(kₙ, 1)/fin≃ADD(k⁺, 1). n<w"
